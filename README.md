# Pi_Control_Hub

The main station to control automatic watering, led's and emergency handling based on MQTT.

# Disclaimer

This is a personal project and thus a lot of parameters and usernames will be hardcoded. PR's to change that are welcome but for now this is not the main priority.

# Node Structure

The idea is that this will be a modular project. Everyone can implement/use the nodes needed. Afterwards modify the configuration file in "Code/config" to include the nodes you want. 

TODO: add flowchart? maybe? 

# Setup on Pi:

TODO

## Install MQTT 

## Install Python dependencies
